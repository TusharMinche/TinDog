# TinDog

Welcome to TinDog, a static website project built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Inspired by the popular dating app Tinder, TinDog is essentially Tinder for dogs - a fun and engaging way to find furry companions for your four-legged friends. While this website is not yet responsive, it serves as a testament to my early days of learning web development with Bootstrap. As you navigate through the website, you will find various sections such as Home, Download, Pricing, and Contact, each designed to provide a seamless user experience. So, if you are a dog lover looking for a fun way to connect your canine friend with other dogs, TinDog is just the website for you!
